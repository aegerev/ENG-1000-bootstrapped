                        <p> Everything needs a foundation. Without it, everything crumbles, everything falls apart.
                            <br/> <br/>
                            Imagine a house. Without the proper foundation, without the proper support, that house will fall. 
                            <br/> <br/>
                            The same is true for education. If there is no foundation, there’s no success.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can try out every single program to speak English, but the truth is that not all programs will give you the foundation needed to succeed.
                            <br/> <br/>
                            That’s where we come in. 
                            <br/> <br/>
                            Together, we will be working on building the foundation for you to succeed in learning or advancing your English, which will help you succeed in life! I am invested in your success, and I am here to help you.
                            <br/>  <br/>
                            It will be hard at first, but it will be well worth it.

                    This is the introductory level to the program. During the class, we will be talking about things that interest you, although the content won't be too "severe". That way, you could still learn English, while at the same time be in complete peace of mind.
